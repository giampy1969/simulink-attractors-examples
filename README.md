This is a collection of Simulink blocks implementing simple nonlinear dynamical systems that have attractors in their state space.
A general 3D Simulink scope (coded in the s-functions sfun3d.m) is used to display (in 3D) the evolution of the system during the simulation.

Currently (Jan 2017), the featured systems are Lorenz, Van Der Pol, simple Lotka-Volterra, competitive N-D Lotka Volterra and Henon. 
Note that this only works for versions 2014b and later.
